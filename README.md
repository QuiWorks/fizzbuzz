# FizzBuzz Exercise

Fizz Buzz is a simple coding exercise used for interviewing potential software developers.
The instructions for the basic  implementation of this exercise are:
> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 each on a new line.
> For multiples of three print "Fizz"
> For multiples of five print "Buzz"
> For multiple of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
> For extra credit write an implementation that uses dynamic values for the multiples of Fizz, Buzz and FizzBuzz


There are empty classes already created in the com.denniskirk.exercises.fizzbuzz.impl package.
Write the FizzBuzz logic in those classes and then run their unit test to see if the exercise is solved.
